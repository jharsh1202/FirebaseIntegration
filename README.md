# FirebaseIntegration
This is basic implementation of firebase Auth

This includes SignIn, SignUp, Logout with Email using Firebase as a backend service.
Also using the navigation controller, moving back to root view controller with it
And Also used Segue. 

Important: Don't forget to add your own Google-info.plist generated from firebase, also either give the same identifier(bundle) name as mine otherwise change the project bundle indentifier.
